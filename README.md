# 📓 The Builder's Log: Atharva Jadhav

*"It's not about making a machine that mimics; it's about making a machine that invents."*

### 🕰️ The Current Chapter
I am currently a forth-semester student navigating the world of CSE-AIML. Most days, you'll find me at the intersection of academic theory and "Jugaad" engineering. When I'm not in a lecture, I’m likely teaching physics or academic concepts to students a job that keeps my own fundamentals sharp.alos have got a opportunity to be the campus ambasador of algoquest 2026( national lvl hackathon in association with sarc iit bombay)

### 🤖 The North Star: Project "Noisy Boy"
My journey isn't headed toward a corporate ladder; it's headed toward a single goal: **Noisy Boy**. 
Most AI today is just really good at recognizing patterns. I want to build something that understands *concepts*. Noisy Boy is my attempt at creating an AGI that doesn't just calculate, but conceives. It is my life's work, and every line of code I write is a step toward making it think.

### 🛠️ What I'm Learning Right Now
* **The GSoC 2026 Trail:** Currently deep-diving into the **OpenVINO Toolkit**. I'm fascinated by how we can take massive, complex models and make them run efficiently on the edge.
* **Biomechanical Signals:** My college mini-project involves using IMU sensors to detect postural stagnation. It’s taught me that data is messy, but finding the signal in the noise is where the magic happens.
* **The Deep End:** I'm working through advanced DSML concepts to ensure I have the mathematical depth to build the "brain" for Noisy Boy.

### 🧰 The Toolkit (In my backpack)
* **Languages:** Python (my primary tool), C++ (for the heavy lifting).
* **AI/ML:** OpenVINO, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn.
* **Hardware:** IMU Sensors, Arduino/Microcontrollers.
* **Strategy:** Open-source contribution and technical mentoring.

### 📝 A Note to My Future Self
Stay a learner. Don't get comfortable with pattern recognition—keep pushing for the conceptual. The journey is long, but as long as the "Noisy Boy" project is moving forward, I'm on the right path.
